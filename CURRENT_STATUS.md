## Completed ‚úì

### Phase 1: Foundation & Planning
- [x] Server specs assessed and documented
- [x] Storage configured (HDDStorage 2TB available)
- [x] Old VMs cleaned up (100, 101, 103 deleted)
- [x] Static IP confirmed
- [x] Proxmox ready for VM creation
- [x] GitHub repository created (ai-sandbox-homelab)
- [x] Directory structure established
- [x] AGENTS.md written (AI assistant instructions)
- [x] DECISIONS.md written (3 key decisions logged)
- [x] PROJECT_CONTEXT.md written (complete mission & principles)
- [x] Session notes created (2025-01-24.md)
- [x] Documentation workflow established

### Phase 2: Local Development Environment (NEW!)
- [x] Created `streamlit_apps/` directory structure
- [x] Built shared utilities:
  - [x] `config.py` - Environment configuration with validation
  - [x] `db.py` - Database connection & session management
  - [x] `ai.py` - AI client wrapper (Mock/Ollama/OpenAI)
  - [x] `models.py` - Pydantic models for type safety
- [x] Created `docker-compose.local.yml` for local PostgreSQL
- [x] Created `.env.example` with configuration templates
- [x] Created `.env` for local development (AI_PROVIDER=mock)
- [x] Built first Streamlit app (`app1`):
  - [x] System status dashboard
  - [x] AI Q&A interface
  - [x] Sentiment analysis
  - [x] AI interaction logs viewer
- [x] Created LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md (complete migration guide)
- [x] Git authentication configured

### Decisions Made
- [x] Use Ollama (local) instead of OpenAI API (Decision 001)
- [x] VM resource allocation planned (Decision 002)
- [x] Documentation-first approach (Decision 003)
- [x] **NEW**: Local-first development strategy (develop on laptop, deploy to server)

## In Progress üîÑ

### Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Test complete local stack (PostgreSQL + app1)
- [ ] Create session notes for 2025-01-29
- [ ] Commit all changes to git

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (This Session)
1. [x] ~~Create PROJECT_CONTEXT.md~~
2. [x] ~~Build shared utilities (config, db, ai, models)~~
3. [x] ~~Create local docker-compose.yml~~
4. [x] ~~Build first test app (app1)~~
5. [ ] **Test local stack** (next step!)
6. [ ] Create session notes
7. [ ] Commit and push to GitHub

### Near-Term (Next Session - Local Development)
8. [ ] Build additional test apps or features
9. [ ] Add more Pydantic response models
10. [ ] Test error handling and edge cases
11. [ ] Refine shared utilities based on usage

### Future: Server Infrastructure Deployment
12. [ ] Create VM 100: PostgreSQL (when ready to deploy)
13. [ ] Create VM 101: Ollama AI Server
14. [ ] Create VM 102: DEV Apps
15. [ ] Deploy app1 to server (zero code changes, just .env update!)
16. [ ] Test full stack on server

### Future: Advanced Features
17. [ ] Add authentication/authorization
18. [ ] Create deployment automation scripts
19. [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
20. [ ] Build production-ready apps

## VM Allocation Plan

| VM ID | Purpose | Cores | RAM | Disk | Storage | IP | Status |
|-------|---------|-------|-----|------|---------|-------|--------|
| 100 | PostgreSQL | 4 | 8GB | 100GB | HDDStorage | TBD | Planned |

## For New Claude Code Sessions

**Always start by reading these files in order:**

1. **CURRENT_STATUS.md** (this file) - What's done, what's next
2. **logs/session_notes/[latest].md** - Recent work details
3. **AGENTS.md** - Project conventions and patterns
4. **DECISIONS.md** - Context on why choices were made

**Starter prompt template:**
```
I'm continuing work on my AI sandbox home lab.

Read for context:
- CURRENT_STATUS.md
- logs/session_notes/2025-01-24.md
- AGENTS.md
- DECISIONS.md

I need help with: [your specific task]
```

## Project Principles (Quick Reference)

1. **AI-First Development** - Optimize code for AI assistants
2. **Convention Over Configuration** - Standard patterns, minimal config
3. **Validation Before Action** - Check before deploying
4. **Type Safety** - Pydantic for all data models
5. **Progressive Enhancement** - Core features always work, AI enhances
6. **Documentation as Code** - Docs version with code in git
